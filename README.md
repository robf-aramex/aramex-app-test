# aramex-app-test
Aramex .Net Developer - Pre-interview test

Please either Download or Clone the master branch.

This code is based on a standard MVC Framework Visual Studio solution. It uses the .Net Framework (not .Net Core) which will likely require a Windows base OS in order for you to view and run it in Visual Studio to complete the test.

Once you have a local copy of the code, please open it in Visual Studio then Clean, Build & Run it. The instructions for completing the test are included on the homepage of the MVC.

You may submit your completed test in one of two ways:

1 - Create a new branch in git with the following format <your-name>/completed-aramex-test and push this back to GitHub
  
2 - alternatively if you're not that confident with Git you can simply zip the entire directory and email it.

Regardless of which method you use, please ensure that you notify Rob via email once you have completed the test.
